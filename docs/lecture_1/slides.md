# Course Overview

- **Objective**: Design and implement a RISC-V processor (Tiny Vedas)
- **Prerequisites**:
  - None


---

# DISCLAIMER üö®

- The verbiage in this course is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to RISC-V or processor design
- It is meant to be a quick overview of the concepts and tools we will use
- The goal is to get you up to speed with the basics of processor design and RISC-V

---

# What is a processor?

- A processor is a device that executes instructions upon data
- It is the brain of the computer
- We describe the _microarchitecture_ (how it works) in an Hardware Description Language (HDL)
    - Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, etc.
- The capabilities of a processor (or a family of processors) are defined in the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

---

# What is RISC-V?

- Open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Created at UC Berkeley in 2010
- Key features:
  - Modular design
  - Simple and clean architecture
  - Free and open standard
  - Extensible instruction set

---

# Why RISC-V?

- **Open Source**: No licensing fees or restrictions
- **Simplicity**: Clean-slate design without legacy baggage
- **Flexibility**: Base ISA + optional extensions
- **Growing Ecosystem**:
  - Industry adoption
  - Available tools and resources
  - Active community

---

# Tools We'll Use

- **HDL**: 
  - SystemVerilog
- **Simulation**:
  - Verilator for fast simulation
  - GTKWave for waveform viewing
- **Development Environment**:
  - VS Code (or similar) with HDL extensions
  - Git for version control
- **RISC-V Tools**:
  - RISC-V GNU Toolchain
  - Whisper ISS simulator

# Accessing the Codebase

- The codebase is available on invitation at this [LINK](https://rv-mastery.com/tiny-vedas)
- We need the email to send you the invitation

---

# Development Environment Setup

- We assume you're using a Linux machine and you've got access to the codebase
    - You can easily replicate the steps on Macos or Windows
- Let's start with the following tools:
    - VS Code/Cursor (I use Cursor)
    - Verilator
    - GTKWave
