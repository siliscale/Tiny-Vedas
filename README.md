# Introduction 

This is the main repository for the free [RISC-V Processor Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDeZtyULZWgMGOpZxxIhsRzCFyqhQ_U8) available on Youtube.

Here, you will find all the slides, notes, and code for the course.

The goal of this course is to design a RISC-V RV32IM processor from scratch, that we'll call Tiny Vedas.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into main + bonus lectures.

**Main Lectures**
- [Lecture 1 - Intro & Setting up the Dev Environment](docs/lecture_1/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 2 - Combinatorial Logic & Arithmetic and Logic Unit](docs/lecture_2/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 3 - Multiplexers & Sequential Logic](docs/lecture_3/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 4 - RISC-V RV32IM ISA, Tiny Vedas Architecture, and the IFU](docs/lecture_4/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 5 - Design Top Level, Top Level Testbench, Instruction Decode](docs/lecture_5/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 6 - EXU, Toolchain and Co-Simulation](docs/lecture_6/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 7 - Data Hazards, Lane forwarding](docs/lecture_7/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 8 - Pipeline Stalls, Multiplier and Divider](docs/lecture_8/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 9 - Aligned and Unaligned memory access, Load/Store Unit](docs/lecture_9/slides.pdf)
- [Lecture 10 - Handling Branches, Control Hazards and Pipeline Flushes](docs/lecture_10/slides.pdf)

# What computer do I need?

All the course is designed to run on the latest LTS of Ubuntu. You can get it [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

Anything built after in the last decade should be more than enough to run the course.

# Cloning this repo

In order to run the examples for each lecture, you need to clone this repo. Make sure to add and use an SSH Key to your Github account.

After that, you can clone the repo using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:siliscale/Tiny-Vedas.git
```

# Running the examples

Each lecture has its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find a `slides.md` file that contains the slides for the lecture, and a `Makefile` that will run the examples.

Before running the examples, make sure you have [installed the dependencies](docs/lecture_1/notes.md).

To run the examples, simply navigate to the lecture's `code` folder and run the `make` command.

```bash
cd docs/lecture_{N}/code
make
```
